Abstract

The “Suspending Classes without Stopping Learning”, which is an emergency policy launched by the Chinese government to continue teaching activities as schools across the country, gives a new opportunity to popularize the application of E-learning space for college students. In order to explain college students’ continued learning intention toward E-learning space post COVID-19, this study combines theories from the fields of ECM-ISC (Expectation Confirmation Model for Information Systems Continuance). By adding two latent variables, namely students’ initial intention and teacher guidance factor, an improved ECM-ISC model for college students’ continued learning intention was put forward. Results from Linear regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrate a strong explanatory power of the new model. Based on the results of the empirical analysis, corresponding suggestions are proposed.
