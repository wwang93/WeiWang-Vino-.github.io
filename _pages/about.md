👨🏻‍💻 I'm a second year PhD student at the UT Knoxville.

🔬 My research interests are in GenAI in Education and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my PISA paper in the field of ICI use in Education.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.


# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Konfound](https://github.com/konfound-project/konfound) a large open-source package for Quantify the Robustness of Causal Inferences.

For more infomation for this package, see the published paper [Konfound paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05779.pdf) at the Journal of Open Source Software.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
