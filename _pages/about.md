👨🏻‍💻 I'm a second year PhD student at the UT Knoxville.

🔬 My research interests are in GenAI in Education and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my PISA paper in the field of ICI use in Education.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.


# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Konfound](https://github.com/konfound-project/konfound) a large open-source package for Quantify the Robustness of Causal Inferences.

For more infomation for this package, see the published paper [Konfound paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05779.pdf) at the Journal of Open Source Software.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **PhD Student Researcher** at the [MDSC](https://makingdatasciencecount.com/)  Lab at the University of Tennessee under the supervision of [Dr. Joshua Rosenberg](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/) working on **Computational social science cookbook with R: A practical guide**.

Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied AI in Education Student Researcher** at the [AIRELAB](https://airelab.online/) under the supervison of [Dr. Fatima T. Zahra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatima-t-zahra-ph-d-6877aa14/) working on **Spencer Large Grant Application about Teaching Critically with Generative Artificial Intelligence**. \
There I worked as GA.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Learning Design and Technology community, I worked as a Insruction Designer to design series of workshops [Teaching with Generative AI workshop](https://workshop.utk.edu/workshopinfo.php?workshop=1352) to equip educators with the knowledge and skills to integrate generative AI (GenAI) tools effectively into their teaching practices.
