👨🏻‍💻 I'm a second year PhD student at the UT Knoxville，major in Learning Design and Technology（LDT）.

🔬 My research interests are in ICT(GenAI) use in Education,Educational Data science,Educational technology,Large Education Datasets Assessment.

📚 I'm currently working towards my PISA paper in the field of ICI use in Education.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Education Evaluation Statistics Methodology（ESM）.


# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Konfound](https://github.com/konfound-project/konfound) a large open-source package for Quantify the Robustness of Causal Inferences.

For more infomation for this package, see the published paper [Konfound paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05779.pdf) at the Journal of Open Source Software.

## 📜 Implementing and Producing Papers
I have experience with some independent studies. 

I conducted a [study](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=114098) on college students’ continued learning intention toward e-learning spaces post COVID-19, using an improved ECM-ISC model. By adding students’ initial intention and teacher guidance as variables, the model demonstrated strong explanatory power through linear regression and SEM, offering insights into factors influencing continued e-learning use.

I am currently analyzing AI-related teaching resources on Teachers Pay Teachers (TpT) using 2023 data. This study leverages web scraping, clustering, and NLP to categorize over 2,200 resources by various features and examines how these factors influence teacher engagement and usage.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **PhD Student Researcher** at the [MDSC](https://makingdatasciencecount.com/)  Lab at the University of Tennessee under the supervision of [Dr. Joshua Rosenberg](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/) working on **Computational social science cookbook with R: A practical guide**.

Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied AI in Education Student Researcher** at the [AIRELAB](https://airelab.online/) under the supervison of [Dr. Fatima T. Zahra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatima-t-zahra-ph-d-6877aa14/) working on **Spencer Large Grant Application about Teaching Critically with Generative Artificial Intelligence**. \
There I worked as GA.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Learning Design and Technology community, I worked as a Insruction Designer to design series of workshops [Teaching with Generative AI workshop](https://workshop.utk.edu/workshopinfo.php?workshop=1352) to equip educators with the knowledge and skills to integrate generative AI (GenAI) tools effectively into their teaching practices.
